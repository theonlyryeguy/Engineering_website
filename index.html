    This week was a great week in engineering. We learned about the 5 simple machines. We started a new project; making a rubegoldberg machine pop a balloon with 3 different simple machines. We have to design the whole thing in scale on tinkercad, which is a little tedious, but it'll still be  abunch of fun. This weeks challenge day was designing an appliance in tinkercad as close as possible to a website image. I was selected to be a judge for the right half of the classroom, so I did not do the project. It was a lot of fun judging people and walking around. People got reall compeptive, and one person--who will remain nameless--even tried to bribe me with real money. The prizes were a kitkat for 1st and 2nd place, and a SIGNED band-aid by Mr. Poole and the judges. It was one of my favourite days in engineering class. Today we are going to do as much of the rubegoldberg machine as possible. I have many ideas to make the project work, and we will see next week if they do in fact work. </p>

        9/5/22-9/8/22 This week we worked on the rubegoldberg machine. On tuesday we worked on our personal one, which I finished that day, and on wednesday, we worked on the group one. The group one is 4 people where we take the best parts of all of our machines and combine them to create one big one. We finished that on wednesday. My group mates are Elio, Christian, and cristian. Today we have a sub in the class, so I think we might not do much work, and we have the challenge day tommow.

        This week we worked on the rubegoldberg machine. Weused actual cardboard and spent a lot of time cutting and mesuring. It is really coming together, and should be done in a couple of days. The challenge day was making a paperboat with 1 sheet of paper that can hold as much weight as possible in 5 minutes without sinking. My group just made a basic paper boat and put a bunch of marbels, but we made it for 5 minutes. Water was already in our boat at the end, but it still worked. Below is a pdf of the challenge worksheet for more info
